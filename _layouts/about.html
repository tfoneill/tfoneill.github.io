         <h2>Biography</h2>

<p>
  My name is TJ O'Neill and I am a senior at Bradley University. I am majoring in Graphic Design and minoring in website design. I really enjoy working on projects with an emphasis on typography and being able to create vector artwork. My goal is to have an entry level designer job at a design firm in Chicago after school. A company where I can learn the ins and outs of being a designer in the creative industry without being overwhelmed by a large agency.  After that I would like to figure out if I want to stay working for a design agency or I want to work as a designer for a companies marketing/branding. Ultimately my long-term goal is to be a creative director for either a design agency or a company.After holding many leadership positions I would enjoy being able to have a job that combines both leadership and creativity.  I really enjoy working on projects and briefs that are fun and out of the box.  I would much rather have a brief that I have to really think about and is open ended than a brief that is straightforward. I have a fun and outgoing personality and I try to display that in my work. I try to create work that is fun and whimsical or work that is different.
